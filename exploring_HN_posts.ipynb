Questions are likely to attract more comments since by their nature they solicit qualitative interaction; wheras expositions are more likely to attract quantitative kudos than comment engagement. \n","Posts in the `other_posts` subset appear to be more successful in the evening Romanian time which is midday to afternoon time US Eastern Time. It is important to focus on the timezones where Hacker News has the largest number of subscribers to draw the most useful conclusions from this analysis, which is most likely US time: Eastern or Pacific.  \n","The dataset has a limited number of columns to perform interesting analysis which limits the scope of furthering this project unless we find or scrape data with more features but it would be possible to investigate further the profiles of the other type posts: maybe there are posts with certain authors or URLs that receive a high number of comments/points per post.
